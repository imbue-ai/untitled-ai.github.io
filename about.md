# About us
Hi there! Generally Intelligent is is an early-stage AI research company. Weâ€™re working directly on building human-level general machine intelligence that can learn naturally in the that way humans do. Our mission is to understand the fundamentals of learning and build safe, humane machine intelligence.

We have enough funding to last a very long time, supported by investors that include Y Combinator, former researchers from OpenAI, the founders of Dropbox, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Threshold Ventures (formerly DFJ). 

**We're hiring!** If you're excited about the prospect of working directly on safe human-level intelligence, take a look at our [jobs page](https://www.notion.so/Generally-Intelligent-Job-Board-62b9247c778447989ec8006951843ce8) and drop us a note at [jobs@generallyintelligent.ai](mailto:jobs@generallyintelligent.ai).
