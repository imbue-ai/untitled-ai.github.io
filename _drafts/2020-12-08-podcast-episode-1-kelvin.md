As we outlined in our earlier post, we're starting a podcast for machine learning researchers.

Our first guest is our good friend Kelvin Guu, a researcher at Google Brain and the creator of REALM. The conversation is a wide-ranging tour of language models, how computers interact with world knowledge, and much more. 

Here are just a few of the questions we cover:
- Why might cross entropy not be such a great objective function?
- How can you store knowledge in a database, in the weights of a model, or a with mix of both approaches?
- What are some interesting problems and data sets that have been overlooked by the research community?
- Where do we expect language and knowledge models to go in the future?

Check it out here, and let us know what you think!
