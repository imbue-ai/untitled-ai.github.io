Over the past few years, we’ve gotten to take part in eye-opening conversations about how machine learning research actually works. These conversations have proved critical to our own research: exposing us to new ideas, helping us form fruitful partnerships, and providing us much-needed feedback on our own work.

Often, these conversations happen as part of informal paper reading groups, lab meetings, or casual chats with friends. The intimacy and informality of these environments lends itself to stimulating conversations. Yet, at times, something has felt off. 

It often felt wasteful that the hard-learned lessons, practical advice, and informative stories of research failures are shared with just a select few, when there are so many others who would not only benefit, but also use these conversations to advance the frontier.

**That’s why, today, we’re launching, “Generally Intelligent,” a publicly available podcast by machine learning researchers, for machine learning researchers.**

In launching this project, we’re working to open up the conversation, to expand access to the field of machine learning and expand each researcher’s community beyond just those from their own lab or school. 

We’re also working to delve deeper than would be possible in a normal talk, not just into the ideas, opinions, and intuitions behind the work of our favorite researchers, but also their research process itself. 

As a result, parts of these conversations will get pretty in the weeds. But we are doing this intentionally -- we’d rather focus on creating something great for researchers than optimize for a large audience.

Our hope is that other researchers can gain both tactical advice and inspiration from these conversations, and we can collectively help the field gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of knowledge and learning.

We chose the name "Generally Intelligent" as a reminder that we all make mistakes, and that in the research process, those mistakes should be celebrated. We care about learning and growing and understanding, and while the topic can be serious, we think it's important to stay humble and joyful in our pursuit of knowledge. 

We hope you'll join us on this journey and enjoy listening to these episodes as much as we've enjoyed creating them!
