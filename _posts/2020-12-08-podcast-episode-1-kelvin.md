As we outlined [in our earlier post](/podcast-episode-0-intro.html), Generally Intelligent is a podcast for machine learning researchers.

Our first guest is Kelvin Guu, a senior research scientist at Google AI, where he develops new methods for machine learning and language understanding. Kelvin is the creator of [REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pretraining](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/08/realm-integrating-retrieval-into.html). The conversation is a wide-ranging tour of language models, how computers interact with world knowledge, and much more. 

Here are just a few of the questions we cover:
- Why language models like GPT-3 seem to generalize so well to tasks beyond just predicting words
- How you can store knowledge in a database, in the weights of a model, or a with mix of both approaches
- What interesting problems and data sets have been overlooked by the research community
- Why cross-entropy might not be such a great objective function
- Creative and impactful ways language and knowledge models might be used in the future
